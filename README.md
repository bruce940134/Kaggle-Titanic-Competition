# Kaggle-Titanic-Competition

Kaggle Competition at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

The notebooks are my implememtations of machine learning classifiers for the competition.

The models are coded in Python and using libraries such as scikit learn, Pandas, and Numpy.

The notebooks Titanic ML Problem (linear regression) and Titanic ML Problem (logistic regression) are my implementation
of linear regression and regularized logistic regression models referrenced from the Machine Learning course on Coursera at https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning.

The rest of the notebooks with sklearn in the titles are machine learning models imported from the scikit-learn library.
